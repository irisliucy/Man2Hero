## Man2Hero -- A game AI with javascript

‘Man 2 Hero’ is a single-player action-puzzle PC game with game AI. The game is developed with javascript in my undergraduate AI Game Programming course project in 2018.

There are 7 levels in total, with game AI implemented at each level. General description of each game level:

- Level 1: A start screen with game instruction
- Level 2: Knife towers with static knife emission
- Level 3: Knife towers with location-based knife emission
- Level 4: Knife towers and wild pigs 
- Level 5: Big boss
- Level 6: Fire entrance
- Level 7: Fire rocks
- Level 8: Final Big boss
